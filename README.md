# OdataServicesBreezeJsDashboard
.NET framework sample project demonstrating a dashboard displaying Error Logs and Customers detail
The sample project demonstrates the OData Controller usage with Breesjs http calls with API token keys. It demonstrates bootstrap jquery datatablejs as well, to display a responsive dashboard. It contains a Test.bak database file which is being used to fetch the data using OData Controllers. Please make sure to change the web.config connection string before running the project. Individual custom ODatacontroller is being inherited from EntitySetController which is ultimately inherited from generic ODataController.
Please make sure to restore the Test.Bak file before running the project.
